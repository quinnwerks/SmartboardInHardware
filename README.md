# Whiteboard In Hardware
	 Quinn Smith and Torin Anderson
   
	 Takes composite input from a digital camera. If something in the FOV of
	 the camera is blue it will output the shape of that object to the screen.
	 This circuit enables a screen with a VGA connection to function similarly to a whiteboard
	 The user can select from a variety of colours to draw from (Green, White, Purple).
	 Stencils can also be used to change the shape being drawn to the screen.
	 This was built for a 3 week project for a digital design course (ECE241).
	 The circuit was based on a DE2 sample project provided by the course.
	 The main component added was the pixel processing FSM's and the FSM to controls.
	 The code not written by us is not included.
